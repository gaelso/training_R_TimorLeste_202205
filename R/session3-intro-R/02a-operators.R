## === Note: 
## Comments: All the text following the symbol # is comment, R is not going to interpret it
## You can use it to explain and decorate your code
## ---- 4 or more signs like #, - or = will make sections in the code in R studio, 
## ---- see Code > Insert Section... or Ctrl + Shift + R
## +++ Exercises are marked with 3 + signs +++
## === Notes will be surrounded with 3 = signs ===

## --- Operators ------------------------------------------------------------

## Maths operators
1 + 1
1 - 3
24 / 12
5^3
((10 + 15) / 5) - 3 * 2
pi


# +++ EX 1 +++
# What is the product of 123 and 26?
# Multiply 3 with 12. Add 15 and divide all by 25.
# +++

123 * 26
((3 * 12) + 15) / 25

## Comparison
2 < 3
2 <= 2 
2 == 2 
2 != 3
2 > 3
2 >= 3


## Assign
a <- 1

b = 3

## === NOTE:
## Good practice, always use <- to assign, it makes the code easier to read ===
## ===

## +++ EX 2 +++
## 1. Create an object aa with the value 14 + 10
## 2. Create an object bb with the value aa / 3 + 16
## 3. Check if aa is different from bb
## 4. Store the result in an object cc
