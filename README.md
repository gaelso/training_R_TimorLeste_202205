# Training on National Forest Inventory: Overview and data analysis for carbon 

## 09 - 13 May 2022, Dili, Timor Leste



### Background

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is providing technical support to Timor Leste on REDD+ (Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) through the Green Climate Fund project: "REDD+ Readiness Support to Timor-Leste: Capacity and Institutional Development".  

REDD+ a mechanism created by the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) to guide activities in the forest sector that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as the sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. Estimating and reporting REDD+ greenhouse gas emissions and removals is defined and bound by COP decisions. In particular, countries are requested to design a system to monitor their forest that (Decision 4 CP.15): 

1. Use a combination of remote sensing and ground-based forest carbon inventory approaches for estimating, as appropriate, anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, forest carbon stocks and forest area changes; 
1.	Provide estimates that are transparent, consistent, as far as possible accurate, and that reduce uncertainties, taking into account national capabilities and capacities; 
1.	Are transparent and their results are available and suitable for review as agreed by the Conference of the Parties;  

National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are powerful tools to provide "ground-based forest carbon Inventory" as they use sound statistical designs to provide reliable forest resource information covering the whole country.
  
To build capacities on NFI and REDD+ readiness, a training workshop is organized to cover (1) context on NFIs and REDD+, (2) theoretical elements of NFI design and implementation and (3) an introduction to data analysis as a mean to improve understanding of the needs for clear goals, sound statistical designs, good quality measurements and knowledge of data analysis tools.



### Objectives

The objective of the training is to familiarize participants with National Forest Inventory, why it is an important part of REDD+ Forest monitoring and the importance of a good strategy and sampling design. The workshop mixes plenaries discussion on theoretical elements and hands on exercises on data analysis calculation chain with a statistical programming language free and open source.
